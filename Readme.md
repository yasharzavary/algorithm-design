# Famous Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of famous algorithms written in both Python and C++. It includes a variety of algorithms from different categories such as backtracking, divide and conquer, and more. These algorithms are sourced from Dr. Ashrafi's "Algorithm Design" book and can be used by students in their projects.

## Description

This project provides a collection of well-known algorithms implemented in Python and C++. The purpose is to help students understand and use these algorithms in their own projects. Each algorithm is explained and coded according to the guidelines in Dr. Ashrafi's "Algorithm Design" book.

## Algorithms Included

### Backtracking
- Subset Sum
- N-Queens Problem
- Hamiltonian Cycle
- ...and more

### Divide and Conquer
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Binary Search
- ...and more

### Dynamic Programming
- Fibonacci Sequence
- Longest Common Subsequence
- Knapsack Problem
- ...and more

### Greedy Algorithms
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Kruskal's Algorithm
- Huffman Coding
- ...and more

## Installation

To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/famous-algorithms.git
```

## Usage

Navigate to the algorithm category you're interested in, then choose the specific algorithm. Each algorithm has its own directory containing Python and C++ implementations.

For example, to run the sub-set sum algorithm in Python:

```bash
cd backtrack-algorithm/subset-sum
python python.py
```

To compile and run the sub-set sum algorithm in C++:

```bash
cd backtrack-algorithm/subset-sum
g++ cpp.cpp -o sub-set sum
./sub-set
```

## Technologies Used

- Python
- C++
